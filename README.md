### What is this?

This is a minimal, PSR compliant, middleware stack that was created as a simple proof-of-concept in the hopes that 
someone will find it useful.  Required dependencies have been restricted to [PSR](https://packagist.org/packages/psr/) 
interfaces.

### How do I use it?

Theoretically you should be able to use this middleware stack in any PSR compliant framework.

```
composer require kwhat/http-middleware
```
